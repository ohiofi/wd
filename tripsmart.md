- Insert a horizontal rule (with a width of 720 pixels,  aligned to the left side of the page) between the  paragraph of text and the address

Service Page
- Make all category titles (found above each paragraph and link sections) bold.

- Copy the code for the links on the index page and paste them below the banner.

•	Choose a light background color that is complementary to the  TripSmart banner.
•	Set the text color to black.

- Delete the inline body code in each html page for the site.
